# Advanced-To-Do-List-Application

- Developed an advanced To-Do List application with a modern graphical user interface (GUI) using PyQt5 and SQLite for database management. 
- The application allows users to manage tasks with features such as adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. 
- Tasks are stored in a local SQLite database, and the application supports a search functionality for easy filtering of tasks. 
- The user interface includes a table for displaying tasks and input fields for adding new tasks.

## Skills & Technologies:

- **Python**: Used for developing the application logic and backend functionality.
- **PyQt5**: Utilized for creating the graphical user interface (GUI), including custom widgets like buttons, tables, and input fields.
- **SQLite**: Integrated a local database to persist tasks, leveraging SQL queries for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **QSqlDatabase & QSqlQuery**: Used to interact with the SQLite database, including creating tables, inserting, and retrieving task data.
- **QTableWidget**: Employed for displaying tasks dynamically in a table format, allowing interaction with the data.
- **QHBoxLayout & QVBoxLayout**: Applied for efficient layout management and widget placement in the application window.
